                            A. Introduction<br/>
                            Company continually invests significant resources to create text, images and other materials on the Site. These materials may be protected under copyright laws of the United States and of other countries worldwide.

                            B. Copyright<br/>
                            Copyright protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Copyright infringement occurs when any one or more of the following rights is violated: (1) reproduction; (2) adaptation; (3) distribution to the public; (4) performance in public; or (5) display in public. Copyright infringement issues can also arise when a new work or a modification of an existing work, known as a derivative work, is created from a copyrighted work. A derivative work is based upon a pre-existing work in which the pre-existing work is changed, condensed, recast, transformed, adapted, or embellished. If the pre-existing or underlying work is a protected work under copyright law, one who wishes to exploit the derivative work must obtain a license from the owner of the copyright in the underlying work or works. Thus, modification of Company’s copyrighted materials without explicit permission for commercial use constitutes infringement. Without written permission from Company, you may not make any unauthorized reproduction or engage in distribution of Company’s copyrighted materials, which include, but are not limited to, materials such as publications, Site content, diagrams, photos, videos, images, and graphics published by Company in any format.
